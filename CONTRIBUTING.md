## Filing Issues

We currently do not provide official support for the Realm Lua SDK, but filing issues is welcomed in order for the community to respond and contribute.

Whether you find a bug, typo or an API call that could be clarified, please [file an issue](https://github.com/realm/realm-lua-bootcamp/issues) on our GitHub repository.

When filing an issue, please provide as much of the following information as possible in order to help others fix it:

1. **Goals**
2. **Expected results**
3. **Actual results**
4. **Steps to reproduce**
5. **Code sample that highlights the issue** (full Visual Studio projects that users can compile themselves are ideal)
6. **Version of Realm / Visual Studio / OSX, Windows or Linux**
7. **Version of target mobile OS**

## Contributing Enhancements

We love contributions to Realm! If you'd like to contribute code, documentation, or any other improvements, please [file a Pull Request](https://github.com/realm/realm-lua-bootcamp/pulls) on our GitHub repository. Make sure to accept our [CLA](#CLA) and to follow the current style.

### CLA

Realm welcomes all contributions! The only requirement we have is that, like many other projects, we need to have a [Contributor License Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) (CLA) in place before we can accept any external code. Our own CLA is a modified version of the Apache Software Foundationâ€™s CLA.

[Please submit your CLA electronically using our Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ga5zIS9qnwwFPmbq-orSPsiBIXQjltKg7ytHd2NmDYo/viewform) so we can accept your submissions. The GitHub username you file there will need to match that of your Pull Requests. If you have any questions or cannot file the CLA electronically, you can email <help@realm.io>.
